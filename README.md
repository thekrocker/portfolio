# Welcome to My Portfolio!

## About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m **Safa Dedeakay**, a game developer who loves creating fun and unique experiences. With **over 5 years of experience in Unity** and growing skills in **Unreal Engine** and **Blender**, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of games, from multiplayer adventures to creative personal projects.

I spend my days working as a full-time developer, bringing ideas to life with my team. In my free time, I work on my own projects, exploring cool ideas like **train survival games**, **social deduction mechanics**, and **gladiator RPGs**. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make games fun, engaging, and memorable.

## My Approach
- **Players First**: I aim to create games that are not only fun but also meaningful for players.
- **Clean and Scalable Code**: I focus on building systems that are simple and easy to expand.
- **Always Learning**: I enjoy discovering new tools, improving my skills, and pushing myself with new challenges.

## Outside of Work
When Iâ€™m not developing games, I enjoy exploring **mythological stories**, trying new ideas, and sometimes making special projects for people I care about (like birthday games ðŸ’–). For me, game development is more than a jobâ€”itâ€™s a way to share ideas and stories.

Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect. Letâ€™s make something awesome together! ðŸš€
