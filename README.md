# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m **Safa Dedeakay**, a gameplay programmer with over **7 years of experience** in **Unity (C#)** and growing skills in **Unreal Engine (C++)**.

I primarily develop **mobile games** using Unity, focusing on performance, UI/UX, and scalable architecture. Alongside that, Iâ€™ve worked on both **singleplayer** and **multiplayer PC projects** in both Unity and Unreal Engine, building systems for networking, gameplay, and combat.

My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that are easy to expand and satisfying to play.
