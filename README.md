## About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m **Safa Dedeakay**, a game developer who loves creating fun and unique experiences. With **over 7 years of experience in Unity** and growing skills in **Unreal Engine** and **Blender**, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of games, from multiplayer adventures to creative personal projects.
I spend my days working as a full-time developer, bringing ideas to life with my team. In my free time, I work on my own projects. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make games fun, engaging, and memorable.

## My Approach
- **Clean and Scalable Code**: I focus on building systems that are simple and easy to expand.
- **Always Learning**: I enjoy discovering new tools, improving my skills, and pushing myself with new challenges.

Feel free to check out my projects in my documentation and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect. Letâ€™s make something awesome together! ðŸš€
