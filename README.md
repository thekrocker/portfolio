# Welcome to My Portfolio!

## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m **Safa Dedeakay**, a game developer with over **7 years of experience** using **Unity and C#**, and more recently expanding into **Unreal Engine and C++**.  
Iâ€™ve worked on a mix of games â€” from multiplayer titles at work to smaller personal projects I build in my free time.

I enjoy designing systems that are easy to understand, cleanly coded, and built to last. Whether Iâ€™m learning a new tool or tweaking a mechanic, I like keeping things fun and practical.

## How I Work
- I care about **writing clean and scalable code**
- Iâ€™m always looking for ways to **learn and improve**
- I like building things that are **simple, but feel good to play**

Thanks for checking out my work â€” feel free to explore the projects in the sidebar.
