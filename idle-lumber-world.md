## ðŸ’» What I Did

- Designed and developed the **entire gameplay system** from scratch, following the idle arcade model  
- Created a **modular unlock system**, allowing new areas, machines, and zones to open progressively based on player actions  
- Built a flexible **interaction system** that supports player-object and NPC interactions (gathering, building, upgrading)  
- Handled **large-scale environment interactions** using optimized crowd tree handling and **mesh combining techniques** to reduce draw calls  
- Implemented an **advanced save/load system** capable of saving upgrades, stateful world objects, and currency  
- Used **ScriptableObjects** for managing upgrades, area data, and unlock rules  
- Focused heavily on **mobile performance**, especially around large scenes and mass object updates

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- âœ… Modular unlock and area progression system  
- âœ… Tree-cutting and structure-building loop  
- âœ… Interaction system for tools, objects, and unlockables  
- âœ… Optimized tree crowd system using mesh combination and pooling  
- âœ… Advanced save/load with upgrade persistence  
- âœ… UI feedback integrated with player progress and world state

## ðŸ§ª Challenges & Solutions

> **Challenge**: Rendering and interacting with hundreds of trees in a single scene  
> **Solution**: Used mesh combining, pooled objects, and group batching strategies to minimize overhead on mobile.

> **Challenge**: Designing a scalable save system to track upgrades and world state  
> **Solution**: Created a custom save architecture with per-zone and per-feature data separation, reducing load/save time and supporting future expansion.

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Highlights

- Modular system design following SRP and clean architecture principles  
- Save system built around data-driven serialization, supporting both versioning and partial restore  
- Interaction logic abstracted via interfaces, allowing future reuse (NPCs, zones, tools)  
- MeshCombiner utility to group nearby trees and reduce CPU/GPU load dynamically  
- Addressables used for dynamic zone loading and content separation  

---

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

- Clean, modular architecture is essential when building systems with expanding complexity  
- Mesh combination can drastically improve mobile performance but needs careful planning for interactivity  
- Advanced save systems should be extensible from the start to avoid refactoring during feature growth  
- Building scalable interaction systems early speeds up future feature development and designer iteration
