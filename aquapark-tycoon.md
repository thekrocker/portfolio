## ðŸ’» What I Did

- Built the core idle loop: earnings â†’ upgrades â†’ unlock new zones  
- Created zone-based progression with unlock animations and level design tools  
- Developed visitor & worker **AI using a simple state machine system** (Idle, Walk, Swim, Interact, Clean, Fix) to simulate realistic guest behavior and increase production polish  
- Simulated **basic swimming and water physics** for better immersion and visual feedback  
- Used ScriptableObjects to define and balance attractions, upgrades, and costs  
- Used **Zenject** for scalable and testable architecture  
- Handled async animations, upgrades, and timed logic using **UniTask**  
- Integrated Firebase for analytics and event tracking  
- Optimized performance using pooling and reduced GC allocations

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- âœ… Modular attraction and upgrade system  
- âœ… AI-driven visitors with swimming, walking, and idling behaviors  
- âœ… Zone unlock system with progression gates  
- âœ… Reward systems: ads, boosters, idle time bonuses  
- âœ… Save/load with a custom service layer

## ðŸ§ª Challenges & Solutions

> **Challenge**: Managing zone-specific logic and NPC behavior across large areas  
> **Solution**: Used local attraction managers and lightweight state machines to isolate behavior and improve performance.

> **Challenge**: Making pools feel dynamic without heavy physics  
> **Solution**: Simulated water interaction with position-based float/splash animation triggers and simple drag resistance.

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Highlights

- **Zenject** for clean dependency management and testable systems  
- **UniTask** for UI animation flow, ad timing, and reward delays  
- **ScriptableObjects** for modular balancing of attractions and upgrades  
- **AI State Machine** for controlling visitor flow and interaction  
- **Swimming system** integrated with attraction logic to boost immersion

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

- A structured state machine for AI gives both clarity and control when scaling NPC behavior  
- Fake water physics can go a long way â€” simple systems used right can outperform complex ones visually  
- Scalable architecture with Zenject saved time in late-stage balancing and patching  
- Keeping UI and gameplay async-friendly (with UniTask) improves perceived responsiveness  
- Separating data from behavior helped us rapidly tune content during testing
