## ðŸ’» What I Did

- Developed a LiveOps-ready backend integration with **Firebase Remote Config**, allowing us to change reward values, event conditions, and pricing without client updates  
- Built a dynamic **IAP shop system** with configurable offers (bundles, timed packs, starter deals), linked to Adjust and revenue events  
- Created a modular **animation system** using polymorphism and script-driven triggers for camera moves, runway poses, and end-of-level sequences  
- Implemented **Firebase Realtime Leaderboards**, supporting global and segmented event rankings  
- Managed timed campaigns like "Event of the Week" and "Best Outfit Challenge" through data-driven configs  
- Used **Zenject** to structure the project for maintainability across gameplay, UI, and shop logic  
- Applied **UniTask** to simplify asynchronous UI flows and reward delivery (ad watching, IAPs, daily rewards)

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- âœ… LiveOps support via Remote Config for tuning, offers, and events  
- âœ… Dynamic IAP system with timed bundles and adjustable pricing  
- âœ… Leaderboard integration (Firebase) with event-based reset logic  
- âœ… Animation system built with interfaces and behavior polymorphism  
- âœ… Modular save/load and economy system using service-based structure

## ðŸ§ª Challenges & Solutions

> **Challenge**: Managing event content and balancing without new builds  
> **Solution**: Used Firebase Remote Config to drive event reward values, outfit availability, and IAP visibility from the backend.

> **Challenge**: Scaling animation logic across levels with different runway styles  
> **Solution**: Built an animation controller base interface, then derived classes for each level style â€” making it easy to reuse logic and inject behavior dynamically.

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Highlights

- **Firebase Remote Config** for real-time tuning of economy and features  
- **IAP Shop**: Configurable offer system driven by server toggles and timers  
- **Firebase Leaderboard** with async ranking fetch + update  
- **Animation Layer System** for pose transitions and performance-based feedback  
- **Zenject** used across gameplay, economy, and LiveOps subsystems  
- **UniTask** for all async flows (ads, IAP, reward delays, transitions)

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

- LiveOps is not just about server config â€” architecture must be built for flexibility from day one  
- Structuring animation logic with polymorphism allowed us to scale new level types quickly  
- Remote Config gave us a huge boost in iteration speed, especially during early monetization tests  
- Building backend-driven content systems (leaderboards, events, IAP) taught me to think from both player and ops perspectives
