## Concept

You're working the night shift at a local supermarket. It seems normal at first — restocking shelves, serving customers — until strange things start happening. Missing coworkers. Lights flicker. Something's watching.

This game blends task-based gameplay with scripted horror events, telling a chilling story of a small-town murder and a cover-up, discovered through exploration and interactions.

## What I Did

- Developed all core systems using clean, scalable architecture.
- Created **smart horror triggers** that respond to player actions, time, and conditions.
- Designed **branching dialogue trees** with a custom node-based editor for writers and designers.
- Implemented **modular AI behaviors** using **State Machines**, including stalking, patrolling, and disappearing.
- Built an **event system** that connects gameplay progression to narrative events (e.g. phone calls, cutscenes, hallucinations).
- Designed task mechanics: item restocking, trash disposal, and cash register operation.
- Applied **VHS-style post-processing effects** to create 80s horror aesthetics.

## Key Features

- ✅ Dialogue-driven mystery with multiple outcomes
- ✅ Smart AI that reacts and creates tension dynamically
- ✅ Modular scare trigger system with reusable event definitions
- ✅ Interactable environment for puzzle and story discovery
- ✅ Day-by-day story structure with unlockable locations

## Lessons Learned

- Horror pacing needs both silence and shock; building slow tension is as important as jump scares.
- Editor tools (like the dialogue editor) boost production speed and enable non-programmers.
- Creating reusable trigger components saved development time and added flexibility for narrative design.
